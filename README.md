# NLP-COVID-19-Tweets-Analysis
The written report for this project can be found in the pdf deliverable "NLP project".

The code in R is found in the file "NLP COVID Tweets.r", which can be run in RStudio or in any notebook by first importing the csv file "Corona_NLP_train.csv" in the working directory and then running the code to reproduce and visualize the results of my analysis.
